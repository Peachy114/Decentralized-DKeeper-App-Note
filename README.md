# DKeeper App

DKeeper is a decentralized note-keeping application built with **Motoko** for the backend and **React** for the frontend. It allows users to create, view, and delete notes in a decentralized environment powered by the Internet Computer.

---

## Features

- **Create Notes**: Add new notes with a title and content.
- **View Notes**: Display a list of all saved notes.
- **Delete Notes**: Remove notes from the list.
- **Decentralized Backend**: Notes are stored and managed on the Internet Computer using Motoko.

---

## Tech Stack

### Backend
- **Motoko**: The backend is written in Motoko, a programming language designed for the Internet Computer.
- **Internet Computer**: The app is deployed on the Internet Computer, ensuring decentralized and secure data storage.

### Frontend
- **React**: The frontend is built with React, providing a dynamic and interactive user interface.
- **Vite**: Used as the build tool for the React application.

===============================================================

```bash
cd Dkeeper/
dfx help
dfx canister --help
```

## Running the project locally

If you want to test your project locally, you can use the following commands:

```bash
# Starts the replica, running in the background
dfx start --background

# Deploys your canisters to the replica and generates your candid interface
dfx deploy
```

Once the job completes, your application will be available at `http://localhost:4943?canisterId={asset_canister_id}`.

If you have made changes to your backend canister, you can generate a new candid interface with

```bash
npm run generate
```

at any time. This is recommended before starting the frontend development server, and will be run automatically any time you run `dfx deploy`.

If you are making frontend changes, you can start a development server with

```bash
npm start
```

Which will start a server at `http://localhost:8080`, proxying API requests to the replica at port 4943.

### Note on frontend environment variables

If you are hosting frontend code somewhere without using DFX, you may need to make one of the following adjustments to ensure your project does not fetch the root key in production:

- set`DFX_NETWORK` to `ic` if you are using Webpack
- use your own preferred method to replace `process.env.DFX_NETWORK` in the autogenerated declarations
  - Setting `canisters -> {asset_canister_id} -> declarations -> env_override to a string` in `dfx.json` will replace `process.env.DFX_NETWORK` with the string in the autogenerated declarations
- Write your own `createActor` constructor
